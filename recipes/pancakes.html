    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose Flour</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>4 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Baking Soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups Milk</li>
        <li>4 Tbs Butter melted</li>
        <li>2 tsp Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>1 large Egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine the dry ingredients in a large-sized bowl.Make a well in the center and add the milk, melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>
        <li>Whisk the ingredients together until smooth (some lumps are fine). The batter will be thick. If it's too thick for your liking, you can always add more milk to get a smoother consistency.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over medium-low heat coated with butter to grease the pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan smooth out gently into a round shape with the back of the measuring cup.</li>
        <li>When the underside looks golden and bubbles begin to appear on the top, flip with a spatula and cook on the other side until golden. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve with maple syrup, honey or fruit and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
