    <h2>Description</h2>

    <P>This artisan pizza dough will give you a billowy soft crust, blistered bubbles and 
     a crispy bottom. It uses a high hydration and long fermentation time for maximum flavor
     and the perfect crackly, chewy texture.</P>

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>

     <ul>
        <li>500g (3 ¾ cups plus 2 tbsp) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>375g (1 ½ cups water plus 2 tbsp) warm water, divided</li>
        <li>1g (¼ tsp) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>10g (1 ½ tsp) fine salt</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Method</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Mix flour and all but 1 tablespoon of the water in a large bowl until just combined, then cover and set aside for 20 minutes to rest. Sprinkle yeast over remaining warm water and set aside to dissolve. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt over the surface of the dough. Stir yeast mixture and pour over dough. Fold the dough: lightly wet your hand, reach under the dough, and stretch a section of it over the top. Repeat until the 
            center of the dough is covered. Then, using your thumb and fingers as pincers, squeeze and pinch off 5- 6 chunks of dough. Wet your hand to minimize sticking. Fold the dough over itself a few times. Repeat
             pinching and folding until the yeast and salt are fully mixed and a shaggy dough is formed. Cover the bowl and lest rest about an hour.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough one time to develop the gluten: lightly wet your hand, reach underneath the dough and stretch up a section of the dough, then fold it over the center. Rotate the bowl and fold four to five more
             times, or until the dough has tightened into a ball. Take the entire ball of dough and invert it into a clean, lightly greased bowl, so the seam is down and the top is smooth. Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, 5- 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and cut in half. Working with one piece of dough at a time, shape into a ball as follows. Stretch out a quarter of the dough just until you feel resistance, then 
            fold it back over the center. Repeat stretching and folding the remaining three edges until the center is covered and a loose ball is formed. Turn the ball over so the seam is down and place it on an un-floured area.
             Cup your hands around the dough and gently pull it towards you, dragging the bottom along the counter to create a bit of tension. Rotate the ball 90 degrees and drag it a few inches towards you again. Repeat rotating
              and gently dragging until the top of the dough tightens up and the ball is round.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a greased plate and repeat with remaining dough. Lightly oil the tops, cover and let rest at room temperature for about an hour. Preheat oven at this time. If not using right away, cover tightly with plastic
             wrap and refrigerate until ready (for up to 2 days).</li>

     </ol>
